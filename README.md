# Planetary System Simulation

## Project Overview
This project uses computational physics to simulate multi-body gravitational interactions. It was developed to practice **numerical integration** and **data visualization** within a scientific context.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Translated orbital mechanics equations into functional Python code.
* **Numerical Methods:** Implemented solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
* **Data Visualization:** Used **Matplotlib** to generate time-series plots and spatial trajectories of planetary motion.

## Tools & Libraries
* **Python**: Primary programming language.
* **NumPy**: For vector-based calculations and array management.
* **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and graphical output.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.
